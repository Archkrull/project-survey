      <h1>Sports and physical activity among adults</h1>
      <p>
        To increase the overall physical health of adults in the region,
        the &quot;Movement for all&quot; initiative was introduced.
      </p>
      <p>
         As a first step of the initiative,
         we want to identify the general activity level and types of activities to be able to
         create a region where all adults can find something to their liking
         and feel encouraged to continue with it.
      </p>
      <p>
         This survey will take approximately 2 mintues.
