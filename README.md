# Survey form with React

The project was to create a short survey in react using different input methods as well as following accessibility rules.

## The problem

I started with making a plan of the question, how to display the different questions depending on which step you are on. I would definitely have liked to have cleaner code, as I feel like I have a lot of duplicate code. For example could my buttons have been the same component to be reused if I had more time to remake them.
I also would have liked to add validation.
