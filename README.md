# Survey form with React

The project was to create a short survey in react using different input methods as well as following accessibility rules.

## The problem

I started with making a plan of the question, how to display the different questions depending on which step you are on. I would definitely have liked to have cleaner code, as I feel like I have a lot of duplicate code. For example could my buttons have been the same component to be reused if I had more time to remake them.
I also would have liked to add validation.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
